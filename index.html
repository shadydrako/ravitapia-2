            <h2> Why Computer Science?? </h2>
            <p>
                I chose computer science because ever since I was child I have been interested in programs through my love of games. 
                I always wanted to create my own games and create something that would benefit the world or bring joy it. Everytime
                 one of my projects is able to work or my print statements like Hello world works, I was filled with joy.

                <b> Flirty bot </b> was a discord bot I made during summer as a little side project. It interacts with
                gives them words of affirmations, and in other cases pick up lines, hence the name flirty bot. It is a work in progress 
                and I plan to make it do much more!
